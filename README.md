Odin Project Recipe Book

This is the README for the Project:Recipes 

I will be using the skills I have acquired to create a simple but useful Recipe book

In order to do this, I will be using the HTML skills I have acquired. 

These include, basic use of boilerplate, using Headings,paragraphs, images and links to move between the page.
